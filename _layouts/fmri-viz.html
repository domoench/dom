        I obtained funding, conducted research, and implemented a software tool for the
        <a href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/research/centers-groups/cvc/">
          Computational Visualization Center at UT Austin
        </a> for use by neuroscience researchers to visualize neuronal
        connetomics data acquired through fMRI. It is implemented with Python and Matplotlib.

        A key requirement of the software was the ability to generate high-resolution images
        that could be printed as large scientific posters. To that end, this tool outputs PDF images,
        which maintain resolution at large scale. Click the image below to access the PDF version
        and zoom in on details.
